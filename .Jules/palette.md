## 2024-05-23 - Chat & Admin UX Refinements
**Learning:** High text density in chat interfaces can be mitigated by increasing line height and adding subtle gradients to message bubbles. For Admin interfaces, reducing vertical padding in tables improves "scan-ability" without sacrificing clarity.
**Action:** Applied "Tiffany" theme polish to Chat (gradient bubbles, solid send button) and Admin Dashboard (denser tables, status icons, reorganized sticky footers). This unifies the visual language and improves workflow efficiency.
